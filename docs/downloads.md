## Download links

The download links for my builds are avaible from my Telegram posts, or from here.

The download links for LineageOS are avaible from Telegram posts, or from here:

* [`LineageOS for Poco X3 NFC (surya)`](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/surya/)
* [`LineageOS for Poco X5 Pro 5G (redwood)`](downloads/lineage/redwood.md)

## Google Apps

I highly suggest downloading [`MindTheGapps`](http://downloads.codefi.re/jdcteam/javelinanddart/gapps) if you want GMS on my builds.

Download the correct package for your LineageOS installation:

* **Android 13**: `MindTheGapps-13.0.0-arm64-***.zip`
* **Android 12**: `MindTheGapps-12.1.0-arm64-***.zip`
* **Android 11**: `MindTheGapps-11.0.0-arm64-***.zip`

## Extras `Magisk, ...`

You can safely flash the [`latest Magisk release`](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/latest) without any problems directly from `LineageOS Recovery`.

**WARNING: If you care about banking apps / others that contains root checks, don't flash Magisk since it will break device integrity. That can cause unwanted results such as missing apps on Google Play Store**
